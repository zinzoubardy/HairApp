# Enhanced Routine System Setup Instructions

## Overview
The routine system has been completely redesigned to support:
- Multiple customizable routines (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Special Occasion, AI)
- Persistent storage in Supabase database
- Notification integration for routine reminders
- AI-generated personalized routines
- Beautiful, modern UI with progress tracking

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the SQL Migration
Execute the following SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Run the contents of sql/04_create_routines_tables.sql
```

This will create:
- `user_routines` table for storing user routines
- `routine_steps` table for individual steps
- `routine_progress` table for tracking completion
- `routine_notifications` table for notification tracking
- `routine_categories` table with predefined categories
- Helper functions for routine management
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### 2. Verify Database Functions
The following functions should be available:
- `get_user_routines_with_progress(user_uuid)`
- `get_routine_with_steps(routine_uuid)`

## App Features

## Testing Checklist

### Database
- [ ] Run SQL migration successfully
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are active
- [ ] Test routine creation via API
- [ ] Test progress tracking
- [ ] Test notification storage

### App Features
